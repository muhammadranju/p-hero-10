  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents
  <small>designed</small> to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
  content and <strong>structure </strong> of web content. It is often assisted
  by <em>technologies</em> such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
  languages such as JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
  and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
  structure of a web page seman0tically and originally included cues for its
  appearance.
